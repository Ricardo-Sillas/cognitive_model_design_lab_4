    "\n",
    "Part 1 of the model creation was to have the original plan that we were going with, which was having a 3x3 grid, and having the agents pick from this grid. From there if the agent was to land on a position with another agent, then the amount of points given to them would end up being 0. If the agent was to pick a position that is unique to only them, then they would be awarded the amount of points that the position has assigned to it. Part 1 of the model creation was used to print out the agents poitions picked to see if we could see any similarities while comparing them. For simplicity we currently have only agent one priting what they chose."

    "For this part of the model creation, we were thinking about trying to make the model more complex by including a warning attribute for every agent. The plan for this model was to have the agents two postitions of the 3x3 grid, warn them if the positions were picked by any of the other agents, and have them choose accordingly. With this, they would be given a chance to choose between the two choices that they chose. With this method, its possible that the two choices could have been chosen by the other agents, or only one could have been chosen by the other agents. From there, the agent would choose from the two choices that they chose, and would keep in mind the warning that was given to them. We weren't able to make this model work, but this was just one of the few iterations that we had in mind."

The only difference between this iteration and the previous iteration was that instead of allowing the agents to chose from two positions, they would choose only one posititon. If the agent was given a warning, then they would have the choice to either withdraw, or stay onto that position. Since we were just testing things out in this part of the model creation, we had it set to if they stayed, they would automatically get 0 points, but if they were to withdraw, then they would get half the amount of points that position was worth."
